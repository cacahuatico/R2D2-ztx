# Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

&emsp;My name is Arthur, I'm a Full Stack Web Developer and Master's Engineering Student. Having a very strong desire to grow up fast, I got good at finding solutions throughout life, not only in the IT world, but also, like when I got attacked by some mean monkeys in Amazonia, when I saved my friend’s life while climbing in Rio de Janeiro or crossing Bolivia in the Death train.<br>
&emsp;I have always been moved by the challenges and aim to find better and aim to find better and smarter solutions, I think programming is a lot about this. “as cheesy as it sounds”, It's all about being a learning addicted and a focused person. Based in Portugal, love science and music.
